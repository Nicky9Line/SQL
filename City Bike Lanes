## using the City Bike Lane data I will use the window function to show safety ratings for each lane, average safety ratings for each lane, and a recommendation 
of what to do with each lane.##

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS "Average_safety_rating",
 CASE
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER(PARTITION BY street) >=4 THEN "Leave AS IS"
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER(PARTITION BY street) <2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements needed"
    END AS "Recommendations"
FROM citybikelanes
